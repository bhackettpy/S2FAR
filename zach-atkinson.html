              Zach Atkinson is a graduate student pursuing his Master’s degree
              in Aerospace Engineering at Oklahoma State University. He joined
              the Simulation to Flight Applied Research Laboratory (S2FAR) in
              Spring 2025 working under Dr. Anthony Comer. He graduated from
              Auburn University with a Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace
              Engineering in Summer 2024. His research interests include:
              aircraft design, modeling and simulation, control law development,
              and flight testing. During his undergraduate studies, he joined
              Auburn University’s Design, Build, Fly (DBF) team and served as
              the Aerodynamics, Stability, and Control team lead for two years
              where he gained experience in aircraft modeling and simulation,
              flight control system evelopment, flight testing, aerodynamic
              sizing and optimization, and computer-aided-design. He holds both
              a Private Pilot Certificate and a CFR Part 107 license, and has
